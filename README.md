# Simple UI for MOA conversions

`npm run dev`

`npm run build`

## To do

- Put caliber and range and #shots in the legend, allow toggling group#
- when resizing a loaded image, it skews the image

- Pre-set sizes for MAM, deer, hog, coyote, car, truck, door, window
- Notes/Dope section?
- Round counter?
- Load development tracker?
- Pure lat/lon converter even though the other thing can do it
